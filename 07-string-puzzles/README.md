# String Puzzles
#### Respond to the following:

1. *In your own words*, discuss what each String method does:
  * `.substring(a)`
    * Takes one half of the length of the string as the a output.

  * `.substring(a, b)`
    * Takes one half of the length of the string as the a and b output.

  * `.indexOf(str)`
    * Tells the location within a string of a string.

  * `.equals(str)`
    * An output that equals to a emptied or replaced a string.


2. *In your own words*, discuss what the following `for` loop accomplishes for `String s`:
```
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      // DO STUFF
}
```
  * i equals to 0, i is less then s length, i plus 1.
